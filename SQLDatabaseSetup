# Setup MariaDB

MariaDB, a MySQL drop-in replacement. MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database management system.

## Installing MariaDB

```
sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
The prompt will ask you for your current root password. Since you just installed MySQL, you most likely wonâ€™t have one, so leave it blank by pressing enter. 
Then the prompt will ask you if you want to set a root password. Go ahead and enter Y, and follow the instuctions:

```
sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service
```

## Backup and Restore SQL Database

### Backup:
```
mysqldump -u root -p[root_password] [database_name] > dumpfilename.sql
```

### Restore:
```
mysql -u root -p[root_password] [database_name] < dumpfilename.sql
```
